                <p>A samosa from the Persian word Sambosag is a fried South Asian and West Asian snack. It is a pastry with a savory filling, mostly vegetables, spiced potatoes, onions, peas, also non-vegetarian meat, or fish. It is made into different shapes, including triangular, cone, or crescent, depending on the region</p>

<h1>Ingradients</h1>
<ul>
        <li>4 potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
        <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 small onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons coriander seed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon curry powder</li>
        <li>1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger, grated</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground allspice</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>2 Roma (plum) tomatoes, finely chopped</li>
        <li>½ cup frozen peas</li>
        <li>2 (14.1 ounce) packages double-crust pie crusts, thawed</li>
</ul>
<h1>Method</h1>
<ol>

        <li>Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and transfer potatoes to a large bowl; mash coarsely, then set aside.</li>
        <br>

        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <br>
         <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir onions, coriander seed, curry powder, ginger, salt, turmeric, cumin, allspice, cayenne pepper, and cinnamon in hot oil until onion is lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Remove the skillet from heat and stir in tomatoes and peas. Pour into coarsely mashed potatoes and mix until thoroughly combined. Cool filling completely.<li>
                <br>

                <li>Cut each pie crust into 8 equal triangles. Spoon filling onto the wide end of each triangle; fold corners over filling to create a triangle-shaped hat. Pinch dough together to form a seal. Brush beaten egg whites over each samosa and arrange on baking sheets.<li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until samosas are golden brown, about 15 minutes.</li>
                
</ol>
